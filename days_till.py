# Note to CIS 210 students: 
#    To save some time and demonstrate the standard way that the command line is 
#    read in typical Python programs, I've written the main program, as well as 
#    code that invokes it.  The argparse module from the standard Python library 
#    greatly simplifies the command line processing, but it's still rather tedious,
#    as you can see.  As you develop your program, you may uncomment some lines below
#    and comment out (or delete) others.

#  Note to CIS 210 students: 
#      You'll see code like the following a lot in Python programs. This is so 
#      that I could re-use the functions in days_till without reusing the main 
#      program.  We'll talk more about it later, when we write separate "module" 
#      files (like the Python library modules) and use them together in a program. 
#      For now, what you need to know is that if you run this program from the 
#      command line, there will be a global variable called __name__ and its 
#      value will be "__main__"  (i.e., Python is telling us "You are the main program, 
#      go do your stuff!"), so the code below will call the function main() just above. 
#
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
